Unamed Chrome Extension Project
===============================

Many times I've wanted to copy the URLs from the pages I had opened to a text
file, and I've always found my self doing it one by one. This may not be a big
issue if there are only a few open tabs, but when you have many it become
timesome. For this reason I decided to create this extension. The goal is to
allow users to:

* Copy all URLs from the current window to a text area or to the clipboard.
* Copy all URLs from all windows to a text area or to the clipboard.
* Get URLs from the text area (or from the clipboard) and open them in
new tabs in the current window.
    + URLs must be separated in different lines.
    + URLs without an scheme (the _whatever://_ at the beginning) are treated as
	  search terms and sent to Google search engine.

_**NOTE**: I'm still thinking on a name and a logo._
